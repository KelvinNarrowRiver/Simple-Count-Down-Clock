# Simple Countdown Timer for OBS V4

Version 4<br>
A new version with many changes<br>
Changes include:

Added Gradients with up to 5 colors<br>
Improved stroke<br>
Increased shadow size and added more depth<br>
Added the current date and time for future use<br>
Added a second reset button to the main dock<br>
Added a third settings display<br>
Changed how the settings panels function<br>
Removed the alignment, now all text is centered, movement can be done by moving the OBS window<br>
Before and After text are synced with the main 00<br>
Improved the finish<br>
Added a Finished State<br>

The install process for the plugin is the same as previous versions.<br>

All the google fonts are available<br>
The install process has changed only for the Font Family Name Input<br>
Now for it to work put in the full family name EG.<br>
For the font URL<br>
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Baskervville+SC&display=swap<br>
put<br>
"Baskervville SC", serif<br>
as the Font Family Name, copy all but not the ';' at the end<br>
I'll do more detailed instructions and put them on GitHub later<br>

If anything is not working correctly please let me know<br>
